/// Twilio's Video SDKs, where possible, attempt to calculate a singular Network Quality Level describing the quality of a Participant's connection to a Room. This value ranges from unknown to 5, with unknown representing that the Network Quality Level can not be determined, 0 representing a failed network connection, 1 representing a poor network connection, and 5 representing an excellent network connection. The SDK calculates this metric only when connected to Group Rooms. In case of a connection to Peer-to-Peer Room the value is expected to be unknown at all times.
///
/// Note that the Network Quality Level is not an absolute metric but a score relative to the demand being placed on the network. For example, the NQ score might be a 5 while on a good network and publishing only an AudioTrack. Later, if a HD VideoTrack is added, the score might come down to 2. This also means that when the network is not being used at all (i.e. the Client is neither publishing nor subscribing to any tracks) the Network Quality Level will always be 5 given that any network will be capable of complying with a zero communications demand.
